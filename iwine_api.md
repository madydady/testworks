# Overview

The iWine is a "smart" decanter for wine. The decanter provides some useful information about the wine stored in it. It can identify the type of wine, measure the volume of poured wine, alcohol percentage, sweetness and the wine's current temperature. With the iWine decanter you can also heat or cold wine remotely as well as shake it to fill with air. 

# iWine API

iWine works as an HTTP server and provides an API with the following methods:

* (GET) volume - returns the volume of the decanter; 
* (GET) alcohol - returns the alcohol percentage for wine in the decanter;
* (GET) sugar - returns the sweetness of wine in the decanter;
* (GET) winetype - returns the type of wine in the decanter;
* (GET\POST) temperature - returns the current wine temperature or sets the temperature to the desired degree;
* (POST) shake - makes the decanter to shake wine and fill it with air.

**Note** There are also two callback requests to inform, when the wine reaches desired temperature and is filled with air after shaking. These requests are performed by iWine server as a response to *temperature* and *shake* requests. Processing of these callback requests should be implemented at client's side.

## Host 

Connected to your network iWine server works at http://192.168.1.1:8080.
Basic URL for all API methods is http://192.168.1.1:8080/service/. The endpoints for each method are described below.

## Authentication

No authentication required.

## Request parameters

Most API methods work as GET-requests without parameters. Only *temperature* and *shake* methods have POST-requests with webhooks for callback requests passed in the request body.  

## Response body

Server returns response data in JSON format. For example:

	HTTP/1.1 200 OK
	Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    
	{
		"type": "dry",
		"accuracy": 0.8
	}
